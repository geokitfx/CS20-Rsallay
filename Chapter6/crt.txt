2. Explain the difference between Method Declaration and the Method Body.

The Declaration is where you put the Method Name, Access Level, Return Type and parameters, if any.

The Body is the statements that implement a method.

3. What type of keyword is used to change the access level of a method?

The public keyword is an access modifier, meaning that it is used to set the access level for classes, attributes, methods and constructors.
a small list of keywords is private, private protected, protected, public, and, if left unspecified, "friendly".

4. What is another word used for describing the access level of a method?

visibility.

5. Explain the scope of each variable in the code below. (See page 143 in the java book)

When the local variable is created inside a method, constructor, or block, their scope only remains within the method, block, or constructor.
They are visible only within the method, constructor, or block. As you exit from the method or block then the scope of a local variable is destroyed.
We cannot access local variables from outside the method, constructor, or block.

6. Write a method declaration for each of the following descriptions: (See page 143 in the java book)

public static void getVowels();
if (string == A || E || I || O || U) {
int string = 1
}

public static void extractDigit();
if (digit >= 1) {
int y = 1
}

public static void insertString();
if (string == 1 && y == 1 ) {
String t = "True";
}

7.

The compiler distinguishes overloaded methods by their signatures,
a combination of the method’s name and the number, types and order of its parameters, but not its return type.

while coding java two or more methods may have the same name if they differ in parameters,
not unless its a method-overload.
