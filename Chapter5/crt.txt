1. Java executes a set of repeated statements as long as a specified condition remains true.

2. 
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
And the The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. 
This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

3.
The AccountSetup.java Program.

4.
A loop that has no end to it and will continue to run without stop.

EXAMPLE
[
if (stringINT < 8) 
            {
            	System.out.println("Password is too short please enter new password");
            	TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(2);
            	continue;
            	
            }
]
Without the [continue;] or a [break;] instead, it would just endlessly repeat the System.out.println without stop.

Overflow occurs when we assign such a value to a variable which is more than the maximum permissible value.
The [int] Data-Type has a hard limit of -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647 adding even -1 to the - value or 1 to the + value will cause an overflow.

5.
It will continue to add 2 to the value of x until x is equal to or greater than 120.

6.
Any value equal to or under 119.
