Purpose: Create a squares application that stores the square of an element's index in an integer array of 5 elements.
		 For example, the third element, which has index 2, should store 4.
		 The application should then display the value of each element in the array.
		 
		 Index 2 is 3, [0,1,2] so it will be 2x2 and display 4
